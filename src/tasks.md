Test cases

- should find shortest path in a simple linear graph (A→B→C)
- should find shortest path in a more complex graph with 5 nodes A, B, C, D and E
- should choose the shortest path when multiple paths exist
- should throw an error if the start node does not exist in the graph
- should throw an error if the end node does not exist in the graph
- should throw an error for an unreachable node due to missing edges
- should return distance zero for a single node graph
